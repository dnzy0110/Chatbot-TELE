KYC Rejection Reasons
Your KYC may be rejected due to:
•	Blurry or Low-Quality Documents
Ensure text is readable and images are sharp before uploading. Resubmit if needed.
•	Expired Documents
Only submit currently valid IDs and address documents.
•	Mismatched Information
Name, date of birth, or address must exactly match the documents provided.
•	Unsupported Document Types
Only official government-issued IDs and acceptable address proofs are allowed.
(E.g., student ID cards are not accepted.)
