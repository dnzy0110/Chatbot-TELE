Segregated Accounts in Regulated LPs
To ensure investor protection and regulatory compliance, client funds are maintained in segregated accounts with licensed liquidity providers.
•	What is a Segregated Account?
A segregated account is a dedicated account held by a financial institution for individual clients, ensuring their assets are kept separate from the company’s or other clients’ funds.
•	Application in Limited Partnerships (LPs):
Investment funds structured as LPs consist of:
o	General Partners (GPs): Manage the fund
o	Limited Partners (LPs): Invest capital and have limited liability
Segregated accounts ensure LPs' funds are protected from GP liabilities or mismanagement.
•	Regulatory Oversight:
Regulatory authorities mandate the use of segregated accounts to:
o	Ensure transparency and fund integrity
o	Protect investor interests
o	Uphold financial system trust
•	Investor Protection:
The use of segregated accounts offers investors peace of mind, knowing their capital is protected and not co-mingled, reducing exposure to operational risk.
